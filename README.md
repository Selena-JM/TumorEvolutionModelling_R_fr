## Description

**This project was done as part of a course on modeling biological systems in fifth year of engineering school.**

The goal of this project was to reproduce and analyze a model in a paper. The paper this project is based on is : [Can the Kuznetsov Model Replicate and Predict Cancer
Growth in Humans?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-022-01075-7)

We reproduced all the optimisation problems and analyses in this paper and we conducted additionnal analyses, like an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis and the possibility of finding global parameters. 

Everything is explained in the report (not yet available)
